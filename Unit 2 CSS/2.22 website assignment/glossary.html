            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The power supply is simply how much power a computer takes. It's often measured in watts, and usually only describes computer towers, as they have a consistent need for power. It lets you take into account how much electricity a computer uses, and from there decide whether its right for you. A good general rule of thumb is that stronger computers take more electricity than weaker ones.</tab4><br><tab4>The battery life of something is only used to describe portable computers, as those aren't usually given constant electricity on account of them being, well, portable. It measures how much the computer can last without having to charge back up. It's mostly measured in watts aswell, or how long the computer can last with normal usage by hours. Laptop users (the most common computers that use batteries) often don't choose a specific battery unless the regular one gets damaged for some reason. The average price range of these replacement laptop batteries range from $30 to $100. Usually, students will opt for longer battery hours to make up for school and/or long study periods.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The CPU is the part of the computer that executes instructions in a computer program. It does this with basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output operations specified by instructions in the program. The two major CPU companies are Intel and AMD, although Macs will have a CPU from Apple built in. On average, a CPU will cost about $200, and are only changable on desktop computers, unlike laptops which can't change them.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The motherboard is the central hub of the computer. It is what allows all other parts in the computer to interact. Without a motherboard, the parts of the computer wouldn't be able to work together to do anything. The average price of a motherboard on Amazon is $96.00, however prices can vary by hundreds depending on which one you want. Some motherboards also come in a package with the CPU. Motherboards can't be changed on laptops.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The GPU is a processor that renders (or creates) images, animations, graphics and then displays them on the computer's screen. A strong GPU is able to process complex animations and graphics smoothly and efficiently. Generally, a strong GPU is required for gaming PCs, because the latest games have alot of complex graphics, and a good GPU will allow you to play those games without compromises or lower quality graphics. For average use, most GPUs will be fine, but for gaming or anything ivolving rendering (ex: video editing), a higher-end GPU is esesential. Examples of highend GPUs include: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Founders Edition, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Founders Edition, however there are hundreds more that we haven't mentioned. Some GPU copmanies include Intel, Nvidia, and AMD. Normally GPUs are priced from about $400 to $500. Unfortunately however, due to various reasons, these have been hard to come by and very expensive in recent years, often going up to over $1000 or even $2000. Like most other parts, GPUs are modifiable only on PCs, and not laptops.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>An SSD is what the data on your computer gets stored on. It is a new generation of storage devices, and much faster than the previously used hard drives. Since SSDs have faster storage, they don't have nearly as long of loading times as previous storage devices did. The amount of space is mainly measured in megabytes (1000 kilobytes), gigabytes (1000 megabytes), and terabytes(1000 gigabytes). For most people, one terabyte will be more than enough, however people who play videogames may opt to get more, since videogames are taking up more and more space as time goes on. Once you run out of space however, unless you add another form of storage (SD cards, Micro SD cards, other SSDs, etc.), you cannot download anything new without deleting something to make space for it, so manage your storage space wisely!</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>RAM is your computer's short access memory. It's the memory the computer uses to handle all active apps and software on the computer. It's measured in the same way that normal computer memory is, however its almost exclusively measured with gigabytes, instead of the other units. Most modern computers have 8 or 16 gigabytes of RAM, as outside of some exceptions, such as extreme gaming PCs or NASA computers, any more than that is excessive. RAM can only be modified on PCs, and not on laptops.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The monitor is the actual screen of the computer. In PCs, computers with towers, they are often something bought seperately as a different component, unlike in laptops and the like where they're built in. Monitors are measured by their resolution and refresh rate. The resolution is how many pixels are on the screen. More pixels make higher defenition images, however take more processing power. It is measured in pixels. Refresh rates are how many times the monitor refreshes per second. More refreshes per second generally makes the movement or things you see on the screen will be smoother, however like resolution, it takes more processing power the higher it goes. It is measured in hertz (Hz). Most monitors have a refresh rate of 60Hz, however higher end computers meant for gaming will often go to 120Hz,144Hz, or even 240Hz. Average computer usage does not need anything higher than a 60hz monitor, which is the standard today. Odds are unless you bought a monitor meant for gaming, its 60Hz. Some monitor companies include: LG, Samsung, Dell, Acer, etc. The average price of a monitor is $200-$300.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>The operating system is what base software your computer is using. This is what all of the things you do on your computer will run on. There are three main operating systems, those being Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Windows is by far the most used one, and MacOS is only used on Apple products. Linux is used mainly by programmers, and is a very niche OS (operating system). If an application or piece of software isn't compatible with your OS, then you cannot use it on that computer, and will have to switch to one that has an OS that is able to run it. 99% of people will use Windows 10 or 11, however people who want to use their computer for more creative reasons (art, video editing, etc.) will probably want to get a computer with MacOS since it has surperior Adobe products. People who want to focus on programming specifically will likely gravitate towards one of the many, many forms of Linux, choosing one based on specific preferences like performance, how customizable it is, security, privacy, or other reasons.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>Peripherals are things that attatch to the outside of computers, and aren't necessarily a part of the computer itself. Think mice, keyboards, microphones, headphones, etc. They are usually bought seperately from computers, with the main exception to this rule being charging cords for laptops. If you're using a laptop, you don't need any to use the computer, however on a desktop you need at least a mouse, keyboard, and pair of headphones if you want to use the PC.</tab4></td>

            <td class="glossary-body"><tab4>Ports are the openings in the computer that cords attatch to. They are the way that the computer connects with peripherals and charges itself. They come in a variety of formats, USB-C, USB 4, heaphone jacks, HDMI ports, etc. Make sure that your computer has enough of the right ports for you to connect your peripherals to, as if you don't have enough, you'll have to buy dongles or other peripherals to use the peripherals you originally wanted to use, which is a big inconvenience. Generally more ports are better, but there's obviously a limit to how many a computer can have, which is decided by how much surface area it has. A few USB ports, a headphone port, and a charger port should be perfectly fine for nearly all users, however people who want to use their computer for videogames will likely need more.</tab4></td>
